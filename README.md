## Introduction
This is a demo application for B&R vision camera. It is developed and maintained by vision enthusiasts and is not and official B&R product. For a detailed description see this [**documentation**](Logical/Documentation/Vision%20Demo%20Application.pdf). 

**Note:** For better alignment between the index number and IO names most arrays start at index 1 (not 0). This can cause issues with C Task since these tasks do not support arrays starting at index 1. Most arrays can be redefined starting with 0 without any issues from a code perspective but it will cause an empty line in the mappView result tables.

**Note:** All tasks starting with Vi_... should not be changed because it makes updating more difficult. All Vi_... tasks use a global interface structure to interact with the outside world. All additional code and configuration should only be done in "YourTask" and "VisionVariables.var".

## Features
This vision sample contains a lot of functions that are not included in the mappVision HMI (Vision cockpit). These include:
- Easy-to-use mappView visualization
- All IO data points of the camera are connected to the visualization
- Image archive to save the images
- Simultaneous use of several cameras in one visualization
- Use of the nettime function together with axes
- Integration of Lightbar and Backlight

## Requirements (current used versions)
Should also work with newer and some older versions
* Automation Studio 6.5
* mapp 6.4.1

Recommended task class is #8 with a 10ms cycle time. For the nettime and axis tasks use #1
